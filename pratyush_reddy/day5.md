# Day 5 — Hunting Secrets: Credentials, Keys & Hardcoded Data
**Phase:** Phase 2 — Firmware Analysis  
**Date:** 2026-03-26  
**Target:** DVRF v03 (Damn Vulnerable Router Firmware) — Netgear E1550  
**Working Directory:** `~/Downloads/DVRF/_DVRF_v03.bin.extracted/squashfs-root`

---

## 📋 Summary

Today's session focused on credential hunting and sensitive data discovery inside the extracted DVRF firmware filesystem. Since `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` were empty (no plaintext credentials in the standard locations), the investigation pivoted to binary analysis using `strings` and `grep` across executables, shared libraries, and configuration files. Multiple hardcoded credential references, password-handling functions, and sensitive internal strings were discovered.

---

## 🔍 Findings

---

### Finding 1 — Samba Password Binary (`smbpasswd`) Contains Sensitive Strings

**File:** `usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd`  
**Command Used:** `cat usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd`  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

- The binary output (images 1–5) revealed readable embedded strings including:
  - Password management options: `-a` (add user), `-d` (disable user), `-e` (enable user), `-n` (set no password), `-w` (set stdin admin password), `-x` (delete user)
  - Hardcoded error strings: `NO PASSWORD`, `NO PASSWORDc:axdehminjr:sw:R:D:U:LW`
  - Internal credential paths: references to `secrets.tdb` (Samba's password database)
  - Error messages: `"Failed to store the ldap admin password!"`, `"Failed to open passdb!"`, `"You must specify a username"`
  - Build path leaked: `/root/workspace/gpl/E3200/E1550/build/cbtn/e1550-26/src/router/shared/storage/storage.c`

**Risk:** The embedded build path exposes the manufacturer's internal development directory structure (Netgear E1550 build environment). Error strings confirm the device uses Samba for SMB/CIFS file sharing, and the password handling routines are present in an unprotected binary readable by anyone with filesystem access.

---

### Finding 2 — `smbadduser` Script: Hardcoded Password Passing Mechanism

**File:** `usr/local/samba/bin/smbadduser`  
**Command Used:** `cat usr/local/samba/bin/smbadduser`  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

```
#!/bin/sh
# script file to add user for samba

if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then echo "Usage:$0 user passwd"; exit 1 ; fi
(sleep 1; echo "$2"; sleep 1; echo "$2") | /usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd -a $1 -s
exit 0
```

**Risk:** This shell script accepts a password as a **plaintext command-line argument** (`$2`). On a live system, command-line arguments are visible to all users via `ps aux`. This is a CWE-214 (Information Exposure Through Process Environment) vulnerability. Any user on the device could observe passwords being passed to this script.

---

### Finding 3 — `store_machine_password` Binary: NVRAM Credential Storage

**File:** `sbin/store_machine_password`  
**Command Used:** `strings sbin/store_machine_password | head -30`  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

- References to `nvram_set`, `nvram_commit` — confirms passwords are stored in NVRAM (non-volatile RAM, persists across reboots)
- `libbcmcrypto.so` — Broadcom crypto library linked, suggesting some form of encryption used
- Usage string: `'Usage: %s <domain> <password> <last_change_time> <sec_channel_type>'`

**Risk:** The device stores domain/machine passwords in NVRAM. NVRAM contents are often extractable via UART/JTAG hardware access or through firmware dumps. The usage string confirms this binary writes credentials directly to persistent storage.

---

### Finding 4 — `store_domain_sid` Binary: Domain Credential Storage

**File:** `sbin/store_domain_sid`  
**Command Used:** `strings sbin/store_domain_sid | head -30`  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

- Same NVRAM write functions: `nvram_set`, `nvram_commit`
- Usage: `'Usage: %s <domain name> <sid data>'`
- String: `domain_%s_sid`

**Risk:** Domain Security Identifiers (SIDs) stored in NVRAM. Combined with the machine password, an attacker could perform Pass-the-Hash or SMB relay attacks on the local network.

---

### Finding 5 — `tmpuseradd` Binary: User Account Creation with Hardcoded Temp Password Path

**File:** `sbin/tmpuseradd`  
**Command Used:** `strings sbin/tmpuseradd | grep -i "pass\|admin\|root\|user" | head -20`  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

- `Usage: %s <user name>`
- `/tmp/passwd` — temporary password file written to `/tmp` (world-readable directory)
- `ERROR: user %s already exists!`
- `users_gid`, `tmpuseraddgroup`, `users`

**Risk:** The binary writes to `/tmp/passwd` — a world-readable location. Any process running on the device could read credentials written here. This is a CWE-732 (Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource) vulnerability.

---

### Finding 6 — Web Server Binary (`httpd`): Extensive Authentication Function Library

**File:** `usr/sbin/httpd`  
**Command Used:** `strings usr/sbin/httpd | grep -i "admin\|password\|passwd\|root\|login\|auth" | head -30`  
**Sensitive Data Found (selection):**

- `set_passwd`, `pool_encryption_password_is_recoverable`, `deallocate_password_data`
- `set_cifs_password_protection_for_share`, `authinfo`, `ssl_set_authmode`
- `do_login_ej`, `validate_wl_auth_0`, `login_warning_checked`
- `do_set_reset_pc_passwd`, `do_auth_pc_passwd`, `do_auth_pc_answer`
- `ej_get_pc_passwd_status`, `show_auth_list`, `basic_auth_fail`
- `hnap_password`, `hnaphost_httpserver_auth_check`, `hnap_host_httpserver_auth_fail`
- `add_webui_authexemption`, `check_parental_controls_password`, `has_parental_controls_password`
- `reset_parental_controls_password`, `isValidPasswd`, `Add_Account_Password`
- `nas_login`, `set password failed!!`, `create_passwd1`

**Risk:** The web server binary contains dozens of authentication bypass-adjacent functions. `pool_encryption_password_is_recoverable` is particularly alarming — it implies that encryption passwords can be recovered (i.e., they are not one-way hashed). The presence of `basic_auth_fail` without corresponding rate-limiting strings suggests no brute-force protection.

### Finding 7 — `httpd` Binary: Hardcoded Credential Format Strings and Default Account Patterns

**File:** `usr/sbin/httpd`  
**Command Used:** Extended strings analysis (images 15–19)  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

- `root::` — empty root password format string
- `root:!:0:0:99999:7:::` — shadow file format with locked/empty root password
- `root:x:0:root` — passwd format string
- `%s:2:admin:rw:guest:r` — **hardcoded share permission string with `admin` and `guest` accounts**
- `%s|%s:1:admin` — another admin credential format
- `Router Password` — label string for a router password field
- `2.4G RADIUS Shared Secret` — Wi-Fi RADIUS shared secret label
- `adduser: name=%s, passwd=%s, group=%s` — user creation with password logged as format string
- `Authorization fails (username or passwords)` — auth error message
- `HNAP:ERROR:Remote management password is same with default` — **confirms default password detection logic exists**
- `HNAP:SetDefaultWireless: GuestNetwork Password is error!`
- `HNAP:SetDefaultWireless: Wireless Password is error!`
- `HNAP:wan username or password has error(%s/%s)` — WAN credentials format string
- `GuestPassword`, `AdminPassword`, `AdminUI_Show`
- `/root/workspace/gpl/E3200/E1550/build/cbtn/e1550-26/src/router/shared/storage/storage.c` — **internal build path leaked again**
- `http_passwd`, `http_username` — HTTP authentication variables stored in NVRAM

**Risk:** The string `HNAP:ERROR:Remote management password is same with default` confirms the device has logic to detect default passwords — but this check happens at runtime, not at factory reset. The hardcoded format `%s:2:admin:rw:guest:r` reveals the default share permission model: admin gets read-write, guest gets read. The leaked internal source path (`/root/workspace/gpl/E3200/E1550/`) confirms this is a Netgear E1550/E3200 firmware build, giving an attacker exact model context for targeted CVE research.

### Finding 8 — `libnvram.so`: HTTP Password and Username NVRAM Keys

**File:** `usr/lib/libnvram.so`  
**Command Used:** `strings usr/lib/libnvram.so | grep -i "pass\|admin\|http_password\|http_username" | head -20`  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

- `passphrase_24g`, `wl0_passphrase`, `passphrase_5g` — Wi-Fi passphrase NVRAM keys for 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands
- `wl1_passphrase` — second Wi-Fi band passphrase key
- `ppp_passwd`, `pppoe_passwd`, `ppp_passwd_1`, `pppoe_passwd_1` — PPP/PPPoE WAN password NVRAM keys

**Risk:** All Wi-Fi passphrases and WAN authentication credentials (PPPoE) are stored as plaintext NVRAM variables with well-known key names. Any process with `nvram_get` access can retrieve `ppp_passwd` or `wl0_passphrase` without any authentication. This directly maps to **OWASP IoT Top 10 #7 — Insecure Data Transfer and Storage**.

---

### Finding 9 — `etc/Services.txt`: Bonjour/mDNS Service Discovery Entries

**File:** `etc/Services.txt`  
**Command Used:** `cat etc/Services.txt`  
**Sensitive Data Found:**

- `Tweedlebug`, `Tweedlebug2`, `Tweedlebug3` — mDNS/Bonjour service names registered via `_afpovertcp._tcp` (Apple Filing Protocol over TCP)
- Port: `548`

**Risk:** The device advertises AFP (Apple Filing Protocol) services on the local network via mDNS. The service names `Tweedlebug`, `Tweedlebug2`, `Tweedlebug3` are internal identifiers visible to any device on the same network segment. This aids network reconnaissance.

---

### Finding 10 — `pwnable/` Directory: Intentional Exploit Challenges Confirming MIPS32 Architecture

**Files:** `pwnable/Intro/README`, `pwnable/ShellCode_Required/README`  
**Command Used:** `cat pwnable/Intro/README`, `cat pwnable/ShellCode_Required/README`  
**Content Found:**

From `Intro/README`:
> "Congrats! If you're reading this then you either connected to the E1550's UART or you extracted the binary with binwalk. These pwnables are for teaching you how to exploit other CPU architectures — MIPS32 (Little Endian)."
- `stack_bof_01` — Stack Buffer Overflow (no shellcode needed, reach hidden function → execute `/bin/sh`)
- `heap_overflow_01` — Heap overflow to reach hidden function → `/bin/sh`
- `uaf_01` — Use-After-Free vulnerability

From `ShellCode_Required/README`:
> "All Pwnables in this directory require shellcode."
- `socket_bof` — Stack BOF, binds to port **1337**
- `socket_cmd` — Passes user data to `System()` — command injection via network socket
- `stack_bof_02` — BOF without built-in `/bin/sh`; jumps to `sleep(1)` returning `0x41`

**Risk:** This confirms DVRF is intentionally vulnerable. The `socket_cmd` binary passing user input to `System()` is a **critical command injection vulnerability** (CWE-78). `socket_bof` binding to port 1337 is a network-accessible overflow — exploitable remotely without authentication.

## 🤖 AI Risk Analysis

*(To be completed — ask Gemini: "I found hardcoded NVRAM password keys (ppp_passwd, wl0_passphrase) and a binary that passes passwords as CLI arguments in IoT router firmware. How could an attacker use this to compromise the device? What is the CVE category for this type of vulnerability?")*

Key questions to ask:
1. **Finding 2 (smbadduser):** "I found a shell script that passes user passwords as a plaintext command-line argument to smbpasswd on an IoT router. How could an attacker exploit this?"
2. **Finding 7 (httpd):** "I found the string `pool_encryption_password_is_recoverable` in a router's web server binary. What does this imply about how passwords are stored?"
3. **Finding 10 (socket_cmd):** "I found a binary on an IoT router that passes network socket input directly to System() on MIPS32. What is the CVE category and how would an attacker exploit this remotely?"

## 📝 Notes

- `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` were **empty** in this firmware — no traditional Unix password hashes present.
- The firmware was confirmed as **Netgear E1550** (MIPS32 Little Endian) via internal build path strings.
- All password storage appears to use **NVRAM variables** rather than filesystem files — this is common in embedded router firmware.
- The `pwnable/` directory is intentionally included in DVRF as a learning resource for MIPS exploitation.
- No private SSH/TLS keys were found in this session — private key search (`grep -rl 'BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY'`) returned no results, confirming DVRF does not include real private keys.
